# Landing_Page_Project

Came back to this Landing Page project, after I had progressed with the Odin Project Course. I was happy to discover I (mostly) remembered and could use flexbox fairly easily to reach an appearance of the page that was satisfactory to me.

Played around with CSS settings to make sure I was happy (ish) with the way the page looked on resizing.

No functionality added. 

I have to admit, at first I thought the project was to replicate the provided image, not create my own imaginary webpage. This is (mostly) why it took me longer than I hoped to upload it.
